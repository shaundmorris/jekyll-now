title: Hello World (Post Corona Virus)
---

Today was day 1 of the new world. 

I am very blessed to be a software engineer with the opportunity to work remotely. Yet today I had to hang out with the kiddos so my wife could go in and work.

Here is a breakdown of today:

* Taught my 5-year-old how to login to the computer so he can get on a parent-managed account 
* I considered visiting the Phoenix Zoo, which surprisingly is still open. 
* Went to the library which closed today. Fortunately we grabbed roughly 50 items on Sunday, not knowing how long it will be open.
* Rode bikes and played Pokemon Go at Friendship Park.
